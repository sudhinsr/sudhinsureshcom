### _Hey,_

Welcome to this platform dedicated to sharing implementations that I came across. Here, you will find solutions that may not be perfect or entirely correct, but I hope they serve as a starting point for discussions and exploring alternative approaches.

With over 7 years of experience in the software industry, I currently hold the position of a staff engineer. My expertise lies in building scalable APIs and utilizing various Microsoft technologies such as .NET, SQL Server, CosmosDB, Databricks, Datafactory, Containers, AKS, Azure Redis, and the Azure DevOps platform.

I encourage you to engage in discussions and share your thoughts on the provided solutions, offering alternative perspectives and better approaches. Together, we can foster a collaborative environment where knowledge and ideas are freely exchanged.

For any specific information or further details, please feel free to reach out to me on LinkedIn. I look forward to connecting with you.

Warm regards,

_Sudhin_
